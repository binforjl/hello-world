Hello,

My name is Joseph Binford.

I like to write computer programs and learn about software development.

I'm currently taking an online course in software development using Python at Ivy Tech (Madison campus) in Indiana.

For computer programming, I've previously used BASIC, FORTRAN, Visual Basic, C, and C++.
